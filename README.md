## Celtics Game Tracker

attempted site: https://a3-brendan-byrne.glitch.me

I tried to create a tracker to help users track upcoming Boston Celtics games, allowing them to log in, view, add, modify, and delete game schedules. I ran into what I believe to be a runtime error and/or a database setup failure so the code never ran for viewing. It uses MongoDB for persistent storage, with challenges mainly involving database connectivity and managing user-specific data. Basic username-password authentication was implemented for simplicity, creating new accounts upon login if they don't exist. The application uses Bootstrap for styling, chosen for its ease of use and responsive design, with custom CSS modifications to match the Celtics themeâ€”such as custom green colors, dark-themed game lists, and a refined form layout.
